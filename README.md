  I love good quality films and TV series. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying deep learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the field of cinema and data science, artificial intelligence and geopolitics and global future forecasting.

- ⚡ Fun fact: As a PhD (candidate) in political science, I imagine a political system as a machine learning model (or neural network).
This makes it much easier to understand the causes of events and facts of the past, present, and predict the future. 
Yes, it is easier to upgrade the political decision-making process and the political system itself.
Alternatively, at a minimum, to choose the right hyperparameters.
